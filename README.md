Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this assignment you will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate.
